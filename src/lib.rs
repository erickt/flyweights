//! Types implementing the [flyweight pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyweight_pattern)
//! for reusing string allocations.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! * Supports UTF-8 strings with [`FlyStr`] and UTF-8-ish bytestrings with [`FlyByteStr`].
//! * Easy drop-in replacement for immutable strings without wiring up any additional function args.
//! * Accessing the underlying string values has overhead similar to a `Box<str>`.
//! * Cheap to clone.
//! * Strings in the cache are freed when the last reference to them is dropped.
//! * Heap allocations are avoided when possible with small string optimizations (SSO).
//! * Hashing a flyweight and comparing it for equality against another flyweight are both O(1)
//!   operations.
//!
//! # Tradeoffs
//!
//! This was originally written for [Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.dev) at a time when popular options
//! didn't fit the needs of adding caching to an existing long-running multithreaded system service
//! that holds an unbounded number of user-controlled strings. The above features are suited to this
//! use case, but there are many (many) alternative [string caching crates] to choose from if you
//! have different constraints.
//!
